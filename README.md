# C Data Structure

This is my implementation of data structures using C Programming Language.<br/>
It's been build and tested by me on my PC (5.2.8-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 GNU/Linux)<br/>
Run make to build projects.<br/>
Then you will have 2 build version : debug and release<br/>
Debug has -c options to include symbol inside binary.<br/>
All header and source code in header/ and source/ directory respetively.<br/>

## Data Structure
Currently I'm developing these following data structures 
- [Single Linked List](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list)
- [Single Linked List Iterator](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list-iterator) dependencies [Single Linked List](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list)
- [Sorted List](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#sorted-list) dependencies [Single Linked List Iterator](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list-iterator)
