# C Data Structure

This is my implementation of data structures using C Programming Language.<br/>
Run make to build projects.<br/>
Then you will have 2 build version : debug and release<br/>
Debug has -c options to include symbol inside binary.<br/>
All header and source code in header/ and source/ directory respetively.<br/>

- Single Linked List
- Single Linked List Iterator dependencies Single Linked List
- Sorted List dependencies Single Linked List Iterator
