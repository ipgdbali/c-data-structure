# C Data Structure

Hi There,
This is my implementation of data structures using C Programming Language.<br/>
I develop it to fill my github repo ;p and also to develop my C Programming's skill.

It's been build and tested by me on my PC (5.2.8-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 GNU/Linux)<br/>
You just need to run make on root diretory of this repo.
Two binary version will be build which are debug and release version.
Binary files is made inside bin directory which will be created after you run make.

By sharing this project to public I hope, Public may get benefit from it.


## Data Structure
Currently I'm developing these following data structures 
- [Single Linked List](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list)
- [Single Linked List Iterator](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list-iterator) dependencies [Single Linked List](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list)
- [Sorted List](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#sorted-list) dependencies [Single Linked List Iterator](https://github.com/ipgdbali/c-data-structure/blob/master/README.md#single-linked-list-iterator)
